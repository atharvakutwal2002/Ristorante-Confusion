# Restorante-conFusion
     It's an assignment done under the Coursera's Full Stack Development by The Johns Hopkins University 
     for the Frontend of a restaurant.
   
                You can take a glance in the screenshots directory.
                
## Note
         No any template or dreamweaver has been used. It took me 3 weeks to learn and code the website.
